# Contributing Guide

After cloning this repo, the first thing you'll do is install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

At the beginning of a development session, you should always start the `dev` script so that your `mod.ts` file is re-generated as you add/remove functions:

```
# Bundle your functions as you edit them.
pnpm dev
```

If you haven't worked with a custom Radashi before, you'll want the tutorial:

```
# Walk through a short tutorial.
pnpm radashi help
```

If you just need a light reminder, you can run this instead:

```
# Just a brief overview of all the commands.
pnpm radashi
```
